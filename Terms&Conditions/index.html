Amazon® is a registered trademark. Please be advised that Vouchers Avenue™ is not in any way affiliated with Amazon and the Promotion is neither endorsed, nor sponsored, by Amazon.

ODDS OF WINNING.  The odds of winning the Prize depend on the number of Entries submitted during the Promotion Period.
PRIVACY POLICY.  The information submitted by entrants and prospective entrants in connection with the Promotion is covered by the Privacy Policy, as same is made available on the Site.  To the extent that the Privacy Policy is in conflict, or inconsistent, with these Rules as they pertain to the Promotion, these Rules shall take precedence.  For a copy of the Privacy Policy go to: Privacy Policy

TAX INFORMATION.  Federal, state and local taxes, and all similar fees and assessments, are the responsibility of the applicable Prize winner.  Vouchers Avenue™ reserves the right to withhold taxes from any winning Prize, as appropriate.
NO SUBSTITUTION OF PRIZES.  No substitution or transfer of Prizes will be accommodated or permitted, other than in Vouchers Avenue’s™ sole discretion.
PUBLICATION.  Promotion entry constitutes permission for Vouchers Avenue™ to use each entrant’s name and likeness (including pictures) for advertising and promotional purposes without further compensation, excluding residents of the State of Tennessee and where otherwise prohibited by law.
RELEASE.  By entering the Promotion, each entrant agrees to release and hold harmless Vouchers Avenue™, its legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, agencies and their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from, or in connection with, the Promotion including, but not limited to, liability arising from copyright infringement, improper use of likeness, personal injury, death, damages or monetary loss.  Restrictions, conditions and limitations apply.  By entering, each entrant further agrees that, in the event that there is any conflict or other inconsistency between the Rules and any advertisements, promotional or marketing materials, e-mails or announcements relevant to the Promotion, these Rules will govern. 
CHOICE OF LAW/DISPUTE RESOLUTION/CLASS ACTION LIMITATION.  Any disputes arising out of or related to the Promotion shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).  Should a dispute arise concerning the Promotion, the terms and conditions of these Rules or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties; and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice to us which can be found HERE or on the Internet.  We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice ("Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which can be found HERE or in the Internet.  For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys’ fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Vouchers Avenue™ and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.  You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that Vouchers Avenue™ incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement.  You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first submit an Entry in connection with the Promotion.

SEVERABILITY.  Should any part of these Rules be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. 
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY.  The Independent Third Party is not involved in marketing the Promotion.  The Independent Third Party is not the sponsor of the Promotion and will not respond to any inquiries.  The Independent Third is responsible for the Winner Selection at the conclusion of the Promotion Period. 
INDEMNIFICATION.  You agree to release, indemnify and hold Vouchers Avenue™, its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents, co-branders and/or other partners, harmless from and against any and all claims, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and settlement costs), damages, suits, costs, demands and/or judgments whatsoever, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (a) your participation in the Promotion and/or use of the Site; (b) your breach of these Rules, the Terms and Conditions or the Privacy Policy; and/or (c) your violation of any rights of another individual and/or entity.  The provisions of this Section 17 are for the benefit of Vouchers Avenue™, its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, licensors, suppliers and/or attorneys.  Each of these individuals and entities shall have the right to assert and enforce these provisions directly against you on its own behalf.
DISQUALIFICATION.  Vouchers Avenue™, its legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parent, agencies and each of their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents, are not responsible for lost, interrupted or unavailable network server or other connections, miscommunications, failed computer transmissions or technical failure, jumbled, scrambled or misdirected transmissions, lost Entries or other error of any kind, whether human, mechanical or electronic.  Persons found tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Promotion and/or Site, as solely determined by Vouchers Avenue™, will be disqualified.  Any use of robots, automated processes, macros, programs or third party methods to submit Promotion entries, and any participant using any such method, will be disqualified and may be disqualified from any other promotions or contests provided by Vouchers Avenue™.  If disqualified for any of the above reasons, Vouchers Avenue™ reserves the right to terminate each entrant’s eligibility to participate in the Promotion.  In the event that any portion of the Promotion is compromised by virus, bugs, non-authorized human intervention or other causes beyond the control of Vouchers Avenue™, which, in the sole opinion of Vouchers Avenue™, corrupts, or impairs the administration, security, fairness or proper determination of the Promotion, Vouchers Avenue™ reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate the Promotion or any part of the Promotion, or any combination of the above.  Vouchers Avenue™, its legal representatives, affiliates, subsidiaries, parent, agencies and their respective members, officers, directors, employees and agents are not responsible for any problem with Promotion entry generated by computer hardware or software, error or failure, whatever the cause.  Vouchers Avenue’s™ sole responsibility for any irregular Entry is replacement with another Entry in a subsequent promotion, if available.  Each potential Prize winner may be required to provide Vouchers Avenue™ with proof that the potential Prize winner is the authorized account holder of the e-mail address associated with the potential winning Entry.  
LEGAL WARNING.  Any attempt by any individual, whether or not an entrant, to damage, destroy, tamper with or vandalize the Site, or otherwise interfere with the operation of the Promotion, is a violation of criminal and civil law and Vouchers Avenue™ will diligently pursue any and all remedies in this regard against any offending individual or entity to the fullest extent permissible by law and in equity.
